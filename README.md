This project is a part of the dissertation ‘Economic Indicators and Market Trends: Exploring the Inflation and Income Impact on Investment and Consumption’ for my Master’s degree in Data Science at University of Essex. 
The objectives of this study are to find the relationships between inflation rates and the Bitcoin price and GDP per capita, a proximate measure of average income, and expenditures on alcohol which is considered as non-essential spending. Since the correlations exist between the inflation rate and Bitcoin price and GDP per capita and alcohol expenditure, I anticipate that the macroeconomic factors can be used to explain both variables of interest. 
The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is used to predict the two economic indicators, then find the ARIMA components that generate the optimal prediction accuracy. Accordingly, I extracted these components and used them to predict Bitcoin prices and alcohol expenditure using linear regression.
For the result, the ARIMA model indicates a prediction accuracy of 55.64% for the inflation rate and 97.62% for GDP per capita. However, the linear regression results show that the inflation rate can barely predict Bitcoin price with 27.53% accuracy, while GDP per capita can effectively predict alcohol expenditure with 89.08% accuracy.
